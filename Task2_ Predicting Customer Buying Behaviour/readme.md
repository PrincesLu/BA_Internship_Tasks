# 1.  Explore and prepare the dataset
 First, spend some time exploring the dataset 
# 2. Train a machine learning model
When your data is ready for modelling, you should train a machine learning model to be able to predict the target outcome, which is a customer making a booking. For this task, you should use an algorithm that easily allows you to output information about how each variable within the model contributes to its predictive power. For example, a RandomForest is very good for this purpose.
# 3. Evaluate the model and present the findings
 After training your model, you should evaluate how well it performed by conducting cross-validation and outputting appropriate evaluation metrics. Furthermore, you should create a visualisation to interpret how each variable contributed to the model. Finally, you should summarise your findings in a single slide to be sent to your manager. Use the “PowerPoint Template” provided in the Resources section below to create your summary and make use of the links provided to help with this task.
